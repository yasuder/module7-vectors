# Exercise 5: Vector practice

# Create a vector `words` of 6 (or more) words.
# You can Google for a "random word generator" if you wish!
words <- c("hi", "hello", "hola", "bonjour", "nihao", "konnichiwa")

# Create a new vector `words.of.the.day` that is your `words` vector with the string
# "is the word of the day!" pasted on to the end.
# BONUS: Surround the word in quotes (single or double) (e.g., `"data" is the word of the day!`)
words.of.the.day <- paste('"', words, '"', "is the word of the day!")
print(words.of.the.day)

# Create a vector `a.f.words` which are the elements in `words` that start with "a" through "f"
# Hint: use a comparison operator to see if the word comes before "f" alphabetically!
# Tip: make sure all the words are lower-case, and only consider the first letter of the word!
a.f.words <- words[tolower(words) < 'f']

# Create a vector `g.m.words` which are the elements in `words` that start with "g" through "m"
g.m.words <- words[tolower(words) > 'g' & tolower(words) < 'm']

# Define a function `WordBin` that takes in three arguments: a vector of words, and two letters. The function
# should return a vector of words that go between those letters alphabetically.
WordBin <- function(word.vec, char1, char2) {
  word.vec <- word.vec[tolower(word.vec) > char1 & tolower(word.vec) < char2]
  return(word.vec)
}

# Use your `WordBin` function to determine which of your words start with "e" through "q"
e.q.words <- WordBin(words, 'e', 'q')
print(e.q.words)
